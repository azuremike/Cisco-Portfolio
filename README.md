# Personal Information
I am 17 years old and attend Newport High School in Bellevue, WA. I am enrolled in the Cisco Networking Course at my high school. This course is 3 periods (approximately 10.5 hours a week). During my junior year, I took the introductory course and had the ability to be CCNA certified. I am currently in my senior year and pursuing a CCNP certification through this course. I expect to be CCNA, CCNP, Microsoft MTA, and AWS certified by the end of this year.
